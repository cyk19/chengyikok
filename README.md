#My Personal Website
I created my first website that is accessible through the link: https://cyk19.github.io/chengyikok/
This website extends information about software projects that I have created in my free time beyond my CV. 

From this program I have learned to use:
  1. HTML for website layout
  2. CSS for styling
  3. Git BASH and Github to host website.
